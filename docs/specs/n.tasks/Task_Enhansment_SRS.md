   - Selective retry based on exception types

**REQ-EXEC-03**: The component shall support parallel execution of independent operations when configured.

**REQ-EXEC-04**: The component shall maintain operation order and dependencies when executing in parallel mode.

```python
# Interface example (not implementation):
def execute_with_retry(operation: BaseOperation, params: Dict[str, Any], 
                      max_retries: int = 3, backoff_factor: float = 2.0) -> OperationResult:

**REQ-CTX-03**: The component shall automatically create checkpoints between operation executions.

**REQ-CTX-04**: The component shall support resuming task execution from the latest checkpoint.

```python
# Interface example (not implementation):
def save_execution_state(state: Dict[str, Any], checkpoint_name: Optional[str] = None) -> Path:
    """Save current execution state to a checkpoint file."""
    
def restore_execution_state(checkpoint_name: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Restore execution state from a checkpoint file."""
```

#### 3.2.5 Task Log Manager

**REQ-LOG-01**: Implement a `TaskLogManager` component that encapsulates logging configuration.

**REQ-LOG-02**: The component shall support log rotation with configurable size limits and backup counts.

**REQ-LOG-03**: The component shall provide dual logging to both project-level and task-specific log files.

```python
# Interface example (not implementation):
def setup_logging(max_bytes: int = 10_485_760, backup_count: int = 5) -> logging.Logger:
    """Configure logging with rotation."""
```

#### 3.2.6 Task Reporting Helper

**REQ-REP-02**: The component shall validate and sanitize data before adding to reports.

**REQ-REP-03**: The component shall support multiple report formats including JSON and Markdown.

```python
# Interface example (not implementation):
def add_operation_result(operation_name: str, result: OperationResult, 
                        redact_sensitive: bool = True) -> None:
    """Add operation result to the report with optional redaction."""
```
