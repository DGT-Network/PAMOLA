# Step-by-Step Recording Instructions

## Pre-Recording Setup

1. **Environment Preparation**:
   - Open PyCharm with PAMOLA.CORE project loaded
   - Open Obsidian with project workspace
   - Have PowerPoint or similar ready for slides
   - Test microphone and screen recording settings
   - Create test data CSV file with currency data

2. **Template Preparation**:
   - Have all slide templates ready
   - Prepare progress tracker overlay
   - Create folder for saving screencast segments

3. **Script Review**:
   - Review narration script for each section
   - Practice key explanations using simple English
   - Note time estimates for each segment

## Recording Timeline

| Time (mm:ss) | Section | Key Activities | Notes |
|-------------|---------|----------------|-------|
| 00:00-01:00 | Introduction | Show title slide, explain project | Speak slowly, use simple terms |
| 01:00-02:30 | Project Overview | Navigate through project folders | Highlight key components visually |
| 02:30-04:30 | Creating Specification | Type/paste specification | Show the process methodically |
| 04:30-06:30 | AI Clarification | Upload spec, show AI questions | Emphasize importance of questions |
| 06:30-08:30 | Initial Code | Generate and save initial code | Point out key code sections |
| 08:30-10:00 | Refactoring | Show improvements to initial code | Highlight performance improvements |
| 10:00-12:00 | Debugging | Run test, show error, fix issue | Show problem-solving process |
| 12:00-13:30 | Results Analysis | Examine output files | Explain each artifact clearly |
| 13:30-15:00 | Unit Tests | Create test file | Emphasize test importance |
| 15:00-17:00 | Documentation | Generate and review docs | Show diagrams and examples |
| 17:00-18:00 | Integration | Run integration test | Show how module fits in system |
| 18:00-19:00 | Comparison | Show comparison table | Highlight efficiency gains |
| 19:00-20:00 | Conclusion | Summarize key points | End with clear takeaways |

## Technical Recording Tips

1. **Screen Recording**:
   - Resolution: 1920x1080
   - Frame rate: 30fps
   - Use ScreenToGif or OBS Studio
   - Record full screen but focus on relevant areas
   
2. **Audio**:
   - Use external microphone if possible
   - Record in quiet environment
   - Speak clearly and at moderate pace
   - Use simple English phrases

3. **Demonstrations**:
   - Move mouse deliberately
   - Highlight elements before clicking
   - Use zoom feature for small text
   - Pause briefly between major actions

4. **Transitions**:
   - Use visual cues when switching topics
   - Display progress tracker between sections
   - Use consistent slide transitions

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **If AI generates unexpected response**:
   - Have pre-prepared fallback responses ready
   - Acknowledge variation is normal
   - Focus on key points regardless of exact wording

2. **If demo encounters errors**:
   - Use as teaching moment to show debugging
   - Have backup pre-tested code ready
   - Narrate what you're observing and thinking

3. **If timing runs longer than expected**:
   - Have sections that can be abbreviated
   - Keep focus on pamola core workflow
   - Maintain consistent pacing

4. **Audio issues**:
   - Monitor audio levels during recording
   - Re-record segments with audio problems
   - Consider post-production audio enhancement

## Post-Recording

1. **Editing**:
   - Trim unnecessary pauses
   - Add captions for key terms
   - Insert progress indicators between sections
   - Ensure consistent audio levels

2. **Review**:
   - Check for technical clarity
   - Verify all key points are covered
   - Ensure audio is clear and understandable
   - Test with sample audience if possible

3. **Distribution**:
   - Prepare supplementary materials
   - Create chapter markers/timestamps
   - Include links to additional resources
