Module: Base Processor for Data Profiling & Analysis
----------------------------------------------------
This module defines an abstract base class for various profiling
techniques in PAMOLA.CORE. It provides a standardized framework
for analyzing datasets and supports multiple profiling categories,
including:

- **Data Field Profiling**: Alyzing data fields.

This base processor ensures a modular approach, allowing different
profiling techniques to inherit and implement specific analysis logic.

âš  NOTE: This is a foundational component and may evolve as
development progresses.

    Abstract base class for dataset profiling processors in PAMOLA.CORE.
    
    This class serves as a foundation for implementing profiling mechanisms 
    that analyze datasets across multiple dimensions, helping to assess 
    structure, consistency, and sensitivity. Profiling plays a crucial role 
    in enabling effective anonymization and privacy-preserving strategies.
