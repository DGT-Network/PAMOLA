Module: Noise Addition Base Processor
-------------------------------------
This module defines an abstract base class for noise addition techniques
in PAMOLA.CORE. It provides a structured interface for applying controlled
noise to datasets.

Noise addition is a fundamental technique for differential anonymization
and statistical obfuscation. Common methods include:
- **Laplace noise** (for differential anonymization)
- **Gaussian noise** (for statistical perturbation)
- **Uniform noise** (for general anonymization)
- **Custom noise distributions** (configurable)

NOTE: This is a template and will be updated as development progresses.
