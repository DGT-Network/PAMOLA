class FakeNameOperationTooltip:
    language = (
        "• What it does: Selects the appropriate set of names to use for generation.\n"
        "• Examples: Supported built-in dictionaries include `en` (English), `ru` (Russian), and `vi` (Vietnamese).\n"
        "• Impact: This is the most important setting for ensuring the generated names are culturally realistic.\n"
        "• Default: `en`"
    )

    format = (
        "• How it works: Uses placeholders for First (F), Last (L), and Middle (M) names.\n"
        "• Available Formats: `FL` (John Smith), `LF` (Smith John), `FML` (John Michael Smith), `LFM` (Smith John Michael), `F_L` (John_Smith), `L_F` (Smith_John).\n"
        "• Note: You can control casing directly via the format. Using `fml` will make the output lowercase, and `FML_` will make it uppercase, overriding the global \"Name Case\" setting.\n"
        "• Default: `FL`"
    )

    case = (
        "• What it does: Controls the text case of the output.\n"
        "• Options: `title` (John Smith), `upper` (JOHN SMITH), `lower` (john smith).\n"
        "• Note: This setting can be overridden by using a case-specific format string in the \"Name Format\" field (e.g., `fml`).\n"
        "• Recommended: `title` for most use cases.\n"
        "• Default: `title`"
    )

    use_faker = (
        "• What it does: Switches from the built-in name dictionaries to the popular Faker data generation library.\n"
        "• Trade-offs:\n"
        "- Pros: Provides a much larger and more diverse pool of names.\n"
        "- Cons: Requires the Faker library to be installed and may have a slight performance overhead.\n"
        "• Default: Disabled"
    )

    dictionaries = (
        "• How it works: Provide a JSON object specifying the language and name type, with a value pointing to your file path.\n"
        "• Example: `{\"en\": {\"male_first_names\": \"/path/to/en_m_first.txt\", \"last_names\": \"/path/to/en_last.txt\"}}`\n"
        "• Impact: Gives you full control over the pool of names. This is an advanced feature."
    )

    gender_from_name = (
        "• How it works: The system will analyze the original first name (e.g., \"Mary\") and determine its likely gender (\"Female\") before generating a new female name.\n"
        "• Impact: Useful when you don't have a separate gender column but want to maintain gender accuracy.\n"
        "• Note: The `Gender Field` setting, if configured, will always take precedence over this option.\n"
        "• Default: Disabled"
    )

    gender_field = (
        "• What it does: Tells the operation where to find the gender for each person, ensuring a male name is replaced with another male name.\n"
        "• Example: Select a column named \"Gender\". The system recognizes values like `M`, `Male`, `1` for male and `F`, `Female`, `2` for female.\n"
        "• Impact: This is the most reliable way to ensure gender-correct name generation."
    )

    f_m_ratio = (
        "• How it works: A slider or input from 0.0 to 1.0.\n"
        "• Example: `0.5` means a 50% chance of generating a female name. `0.7` means a 70% chance.\n"
        "• Impact: Controls the gender balance in the generated data when no gender information is provided.\n"
        "• Default: `0.5`"
    )

    consistency_mechanism = (
        "• What it does: Guarantees that \"John Doe\" is always replaced by \"Mark Smith\" every time the operation runs.\n"
        "• Options:\n"
        "- `prgn`: A fast, stateless method using a cryptographic key. Best for performance.\n"
        "- `mapping`: A stateful method that stores every original-to-fake pair. Slower but allows you to save and reuse the exact same mappings.\n"
        "• Recommended: `prgn` for most scenarios.\n"
        "• Default: `prgn`"
    )

    id_field = (
        "• What it does: Provides a stable identifier for each record to the generation logic.\n"
        "• Note: In the current `NameGenerator` implementation, consistency is primarily based on the original name value itself, not this ID field. Therefore, it will not help resolve name typos into a single fake identity.\n"
        "• Impact: Limited for this specific operation, but may be used by other generator types."
    )

    key = (
        "• What it does: Acts like a password for the generation algorithm. The same key with the same input name will always produce the same output name.\n"
        "• Example: `my-secret-project-key-2025`\n"
        "• Impact: Crucial for consistency. If you lose the key, you cannot reproduce the same fake names again."
    )

    context_salt = (
        "• How it works: It's mixed with the key during generation.\n"
        "• Example: Use `dev` for development and `prod` for production. \"John Doe\" with the same key will become \"Mark Smith\" in `dev` but \"Peter Jones\" in `prod`.\n"
        "• Impact: Allows you to create multiple, distinct pseudonymized datasets from a single source."
    )

    mapping_store_path = (
        "• What it does: Specifies a file (e.g., C:\\mappings\\customer_names.json) that stores the lookup table.\n"
        "• Impact: If the file exists, the operation will reuse its mappings. If not, a new map can be created and saved there."
    )

    save_mapping = (
        "• What it does: Writes the complete list of original names and their corresponding fake names to a file after the operation finishes.\n"
        "• Impact: Enables perfect consistency across future runs and allows for auditing, but the saved file will contain sensitive original data and must be secured."
    )

    mode = (
        "• Options:\n"
        "- `REPLACE`: Overwrites the original name column with fake names. This is a destructive action.\n"
        "- `ENRICH`: Keeps the original column and adds a new column containing the fake names.\n"
        "• Recommended: `ENRICH` for safety and data validation."
    )

    output_field_name = (
        "• How it works: If you leave this blank, a name will be automatically created using the Column Prefix and the original field name.\n"
        "• Example: `fake_customer_name`"
    )

    column_prefix = (
        "• How it works: If your original column is customer_name and the prefix is fake_, the new column will be named fake_customer_name.\n"
        "• Example: `fake_`, `anon_`, `synthetic_`"
    )

    null_strategy = (
        "• Options:\n"
        "- `preserve`: Keeps the null values as they are (default).\n"
        "- `replace`: Generates a new fake name to fill in the blank.\n"
        "• Recommended: `preserve` to maintain the original data's completeness characteristics."
    )

    force_recalculation = (
        "• What it does: Ignores any previously saved results (cache) for this exact operation and re-generates all data from scratch.\n"
        "• Impact: Use this if you have changed a setting or the underlying data and need to ensure the results are fresh."
